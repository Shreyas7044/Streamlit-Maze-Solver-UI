# 🧩 User Interface with Python – Maze Solver

User Interface (UI) is the point where a user interacts with a machine using devices like a mouse, keyboard, or touch screen. The goal of an effective UI is to make interactions simple, intuitive, and efficient.

This project demonstrates how to build a **browser-based User Interface using Python and Streamlit** to solve maze images interactively.

---

## 🚀 Project Features
- Upload your own maze image or use a default maze
- Interactive sliders to select start and end points
- Real-time visualization of selected points
- Solve and display the shortest path visually
- Browser-based UI powered by Streamlit

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Streamlit
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## 🔄 How the Application Works
- User uploads a maze image or selects a default maze.
- Sliders allow repositioning of start and end points.
- Streamlit reruns the script dynamically on interaction.
- Clicking Solve Maze computes and draws the shortest path.

## ♻️ Reusability
- Replace the maze-solving logic in maze.py
- Integrate A*, BFS, or Dijkstra algorithms
- Extend to robotics path planning or AI projec
